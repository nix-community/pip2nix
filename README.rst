Why another .nix generator for Python?
======================================

The original author of `pip2nix` started the project with the following motivation:

  I needed something that can work not only with pypi but also with local paths,
  VCS links, and dependency links. I couldn't get any of the other generators to
  work, so I started my own :-)

Major difference between `pip2nix` and `pypi2nix` is that `pip2nix` can be used to extend `nixpkgs` Python package set and reuse its package functions where `pypi2nix` maintains separate package tree from `nixpkgs`. Both approaches have their own pros and cons.


Installation
============

Be aware that `pip2nix` is not yet mature software. It is a tool to aid Python
developers who use Nix to automate a good chunk of the work to maintain a Nix
based development environments.

The recommended usage at the moment is inside of a `nix-shell`, since this
avoids putting a specific version into the user's environment::

  $ git clone https://github.com/nix-community/pip2nix
  $ cd pip2nix
  $ nix-shell release.nix -A pip2nix.python36

Alternatively `pip2nix` can be installed into the user's environment::

  $ git clone https://github.com/nix-community/pip2nix
  $ nix-env -f pip2nix/release.nix -iA pip2nix.python36


Usage
=====

To generate python-packages.nix for a set of requirements::

    $ pip2nix generate -r requirements.txt

``pip2nix generate`` takes the same set of package specifications ``pip
install`` does.
